# Media Library

## 📖 Overview
This repository hosts videos and other media resources that are specifically curated for **demos, presentations, and project showcases**. The goal is to have a location where team members can access and share visual content without the restrictions of platforms like YouTube or other external services.

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Site
The media files in this repository are accessible through our dedicated [GitHub Pages site](https://inab.github.io/inab-media-library/). The site dynamically lists all the available videos, allowing team members to view and download content directly from the browser.

- **GitHub Pages URL**: [https://inab.github.io/inab-media-library/](https://inab.github.io/inab-media-library/)

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

```
📁 docs/                         # Contains the index.html and the main content for the GitHub Pages site
 └── 📁 videos/                  # Main directory for all video content
     ├── 📁 project1/            # Subfolder for Project 1 demos
     ├── 📁 project2/            # Subfolder for Project 2 demos
     └── 📁 openebench/          # Subfolder for OpenEBench-related content
```

## 🗂️ Adding New Content
To add new videos or other media files:

1. **Navigate to the appropriate folder** in the `docs/videos/` directory that corresponds to the relevant project or topic.
2. **Upload the video** using GitHub's web interface or through a pull request (ideally, but not necessary).
3. **Commit your changes**.
4. The video will automatically appear on the GitHub Pages site after the changes are pushed.

### File Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names that include the project or demo name (e.g., `projectX_overview.mp4`, `observatory_tutorial.mov`).
- Avoid spaces; use underscores or hyphens instead.

## 🔧 Viewing and Sharing Videos
- To view a video directly in your browser, visit the [GitHub Pages site](https://inab.github.io/inab-media-library/) and click on the video link.
- You can share the direct URL of the GitHub Pages site or individual video links for easy access.

## ❗ Important Guidelines
- **Do not upload sensitive or unpublished content** unless you have permission to share it.
- Ensure all media files are properly reviewed for quality and relevance before adding them to the library.
- If you encounter issues or broken links, contact the repository maintainers or submit a GitHub issue.
